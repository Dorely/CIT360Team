/**
 * The JSONInputStream class is used when you want to read JSON from any type of InputStream such
 * as a FileInputStream or a SocketInputStream.  If you want to convert JSON string to the 
 * appropriate Object and Array representations use the JSONUtilities.parse methods instead.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * When your JSON is being parsed any JSON objects that it finds will be converted to HashMaps and
 *  any arrays found will be converted to ArrayLists.  All keys and values in the HashMaps generated
 *   are Strings and all values in the ArrayLists generated are Strings.
 *  <br/>
 *  <ul>
 *  <li><b>Example 1 JSON:</b> ["1", "hello", {"name":"fred","age":"23"}]</li>
 *  <li><b>Example 1 Result:</b>  An ArrayList with three values: a String "1", a String "hello", and a HashMap 
 *  as the third value in the ArrayList.  This HashMap has two key/value pairs: "name"/"fred" and "age"/"23".</li>
 *  </ul>
 * <br/>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Example 2 JSON:</b> {"state":"Idaho", "city":"Rexburg", "people":["bob","sue"]}</li>
 * <li><b>Example 2 Result:</b> A HashMap with three key/value pairs: "state"/"Idaho", "city"/"Rexburg", and
 *  "people"/ArrayList.  The ArrayList that is the value for the "people" key has two String values 
 *  "bob" and "sue".</li>
 *  </ul>
 *  <br/>
 *  <br/>
 *  While these examples only show two levels of depth your JSON string can go to any depth level.  You
 *  can have any combination of arrays, objects, sub-arrays, and sub-objects.
